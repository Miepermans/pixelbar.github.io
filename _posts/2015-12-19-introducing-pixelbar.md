title: Introducing Pixelbar
---

Starting 2016, Rotterdam will officially have a proper hackerspace: Pixelbar. We've been a small community and are prepping a workspace in [M4H](http://stadshavensrotterdam.nl/deelgebieden/merwe-vierhavens/). It's time to meet, socialize and collaborate in 010. Bring your knowledge and ideas about computers, machinery, tech, science, digital art and let's get this party started!

### What do we offer?

In addition to our workspace, we bring a few other things to the table:

* Awesome members that would like to meet you.
* Work with you on projects and explain how we've build a few of our own on our [wiki](https://wiki.pixelbar.nl/index.php/Main_Page).
* Learn you more through e.g. [workshops](https://pixelbar.nl/workshops/) and make them accessible for anyone that wants to learn.
* Give you insight on our code using [Github](https://github.com/pixelbar).
* Visit (local and international) hackathons and other hackerspaces together.

Check out **â˜°** to see more.


### What can I do?

Maybe you're already familiar with the hackerspace community, or maybe you're not. You might have heard of us through a friend, or about us on the news. Either way, the thing you should know is hackers come in many forms: from food- to IKEA-hacking and obviously computer-hacking too. Everything is possible, as long as you share that information - you're a hacker.

If that's the case, you're welcome to join us by:
