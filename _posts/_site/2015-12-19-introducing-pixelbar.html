<p>Starting 2016, Rotterdam will officially have a proper hackerspace: Pixelbar. We’ve been a small community and are prepping a workspace in <a href="http://stadshavensrotterdam.nl/deelgebieden/merwe-vierhavens/">M4H</a>. It’s time to meet, socialize and collaborate in 010. Bring your knowledge and ideas about computers, machinery, tech, science, digital art and let’s get this party started!</p>

<p>In addition to our workspace, we bring a few other things to the table:</p>

  <li>Learn you more through e.g. <a href="/workshops">workshops</a> and make them accessible for anyone that wants to learn.</li>

<p>Maybe you’re already familiar with the hackerspace community, or maybe you’re not. You might have heard of us through a friend, or about us on the news. Either way, the thing you should know is hackers come in many forms: from food- to IKEA-hacking and obviously computer-hacking too. Everything is possible, as long as you share that information - you’re a hacker.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, you’re welcome to join us by:</p>
