Are you ready for a party? Because we're planning to officially open the hackerspace on **Saturday, Februari 13th**. So make sure to put that date in your calendar!

When you stop by that day, you can expect several workshops from us and others at the [Keilewerf](http://www.keilewerf.nl/). From making furniture to hacking with Arduino's, it's all happening. And, there will be great talks from people in the hacker community and live music from several bands!

The complete agenda will be published on our site soon.
