title: Buildlog new space part 2
---

So, we can start each post with a standard "we're back again" however we though it was a better idea to show you what we did so-far. On Kingsday 2016 we came together with some of our members to start working on the walls of the new hackerspace.

### Our Agenda

We started the day getting some wood, After we brought the new materials back to the space we started working on a frame for one of the walls. At noon, we had finished our first wall frame. Later during the day we made another frame. At least it's a start.

### Next build meetup

This weekend, on Saturday 30th of April we will be back at Pixelbar to continue our work. The additional wood has arrived and we are really looking forward to continue building Pixelbar!. If you are around, feel free to drop by. ( but note, we might ask you to help us ;) ).

### Project WiFi

Together with Keilewerf, we thought of an central WiFi network infrastructure. The "old" WiFi network was only working in the central kitchen. Unfortunately the reach was not enough for all of the awesome neighbours we have at the Keilewerf. Dennus and Miep started working on the new WiFi environment on Kingsday. At the end of the evening everything worked! We had places 1 small rack as distribution and 5 Accesspoints were placed at this moment, 2 more are to be placed in Pixelbar itself. For complete awesomeness we have added 2 racks to our hackerspace ( which were sponsored by [nifhack'(http://www.nifhack.nl). We will distribute the network of our hackerspace centrally via these racks.
